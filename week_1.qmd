# Summary

In week 1 we were introduced to the basic concepts of Remote Sensing which I'll cover briefly below.

To start with some definitions:

-   Remote sensing is the collection of data about the Earth from the atmosphere with various technologies that utilise electromagnetic (EM) waves.

-   Electromagnetic waves are sources of EM energy used in remote sensing can come from sources like the Sun, or sensors such as LiDAR sending out their own light from a laser and then measuring the the return time for those laser pulses to identify information about the surface of the Earth.

## Electromagnetic Waves

The electromagnetic spectrum is essentially the energy that makes remote sensing work.

All matter that is above absolute zero temperatures (-273.15°C) radiates EM energy due to molecules moving against one another, and there are several complex processes which can change how much EM energy is radiated, such as temperature. Essentially all natural objects receive and re-emit energy, and we can measure and use this data to identify the material the light is reflecting off of such as vegetation.

## Sensors

### Active and Passive Sensors

**Passive sensing** refers to using an external source of EM energy to operate. Commonly the EM energy emitted by the Sun is used to measure the reflection and absorption of light by objects and this data is collected by Satellites which produce images of the Earth.

For passive sensors it is important to remember that weather such as clouds or particles in the atmosphere can interfere with the EM energy and cause scattering which can interfere with the image produced. One example of this is **Rayleigh scattering** where nitrogen and oxygen particles in the air interact with the Sun's emitted EM waves to create the sunset effect.

Ways in which this can be corrected will be expanded upon in Week X.

**Active sensors** rely on a source of EM to emit and receive electromagnetic waves and measure the backscatter of said wave. For example LiDAR emits rapid laser pulses to collect information about the object or surface based on the return time of the laser pulse.

As such active sensors such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sends electromagnetic waves that are not on the light spectrum to the Earth which are not interfered with by clouds or atmospheric particles allowing the sensor to capture information at night.

We can also think about it in simpler terms, the cameras that exist on our mobile phones are light sensors, allowing us to take images of the environment around us without necessarily making physical contact with it.

### Resolutions

There are 4 resolutions in remote sensed imagery

| Resolution | Definition | Use |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Spatial | The size of each pixel in an image corresponds to an area of the Earth's surface, e.g. one pixel can correspond to as little as a few centimetres (high resolution) to 10km. | Images of the Earth can be used to detect objects such as buildings. A high spatial resolution allows us to see more detail. |
| Spectral | Senors which can distinguish between more closely spaced waves are said to measure more Bands of imagery i.e. more wavelengths. | A high spectral resolution allows us to identify particular types of minerals, vegetation or other features because each object has a unique spectral signature. |
| Temporal | The time it takes for a satellite to make an orbit and end at the same observation area. Satellites can have orbits as short as 1 day, or much longer. | Allows us to see change over time for a particular area of observation. |
| Radiometric | Information in each pixel of the image, measured by the number of bits. A 4-bit image indicates there are 16 digital values (grayscale shades) in an image. The more bits the more subtle information can be discerned from the image. | Can create really detailed images when being able to detect very slight differences in energy, can detect very subtle changes in environments or land use. |

## Spectral signatures

Different surfaces such as concrete or grassland will reflect EM waves in different ways, creating unique 'signatures' that help us identify the type of surface. These signatures reflect various characteristics such as differences between dry and moist ground.

For example vegetation tends to absorb visible light (blue and red light specifically used for photosynthesis) and reflects near-infrared energy which can be captured and summarised in a chart. The health of vegetation can be measured in this way as unhealthy plants with less chlorophyll will reflect differently to healthy plants.

# Applications

## Open source data - Landsat and Sentinel

This week we started working with some open satellite data from the Sentinel and Landsat satellites. Sentinel satellites are run by the Copernicus Programme at the European Space Agency and provide high spatial resolution imagery (10-60m per pixel).

The Landsat program started by NASA and the US Geological Survey in 1972 has provided imagery across the world.

## SNAP

During the practical I used SNAP to interact with Sentinel satellite imagery learning how to render these in true colour (RGB) and extract statistics from the data such as the nature of vegetation, e.g. whether the soil is wet or dry.

I started the practical by looking at recent satellite imagery of Gdansk in January 2026 where large snowfall was reflected in the scatter plot I produced. In order to compute this using the near-infared and green light that plant matter reflects I had to understand the RGB bands used to produce the scatter plot from B4 - B8. In the image for Gdansk and the surrounding areas we can see a lot of wet bare soil which makes sense.

### Scatter plot

The scatter plot above shows the Band 4 (x axis) and Band 8 (y axis), which are the red and near-infrared bands, so here the lower values of Band 8 and Band 4 are indicating wet bare soil which makes sense given the winter period.

### Tasseled Cap Transformation

The Tasseled Cap Transformation is a method used to analyse the spectral data from multiple bands into a standardised image which incorporates information about surface brightness, vegetation greenness and moisture content.

Brightness is associated with bare soil or manmade surface helping to identify urban areas. Greeness is associated with green vegetation and wetness with moisture.

# Reflections

The use of both multispectral and SAR imagery to extract information about the natural and urban environments across the world is a powerful tool that has many applications. The environmental monitoring examples for applied ecologists outlined by Yifang Ban (2014) in order to classify crops and observe their growth was interesting to read about, and I can imagine how valuable this data is during unprecedented weather events that can exacerbate food shortages in vulnerable regions. 

Personally, working at a Local Council I would be interested to read more about the urban applications of these techniques for monitoring smaller areas of vegetation such as urban farms, or looking at the impact to infrastructure under extreme weather events. Combined with studies of how environmental changes impact citizens and their health outcomes would provide an insightful avenue for using satellite data alongside geodemographic data.
