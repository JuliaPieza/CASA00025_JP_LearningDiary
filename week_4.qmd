title: "Week 4: Policy"
---

In week 4 we looked at how remotely sensed data has been used in policymaking. For example using NDVI to look at the benefits of greenspace on both mental and physical health, or the impact of urban heat such as the Urban Heat Island effect.

We were asked to imagine how a remotely sensed dataset may be incorporated into policymaking at a city, national or international level.

In this week I'll focus on Gdansk and the Gdansk 2030 Plus City Development Strategy, specifically the Green City objective which aims to improve the biodiversity of the city and provide more green spaces to residents.

## Summary

-   specific datasets

-   other studies show impact of greening

Reflections

-   what is in the power of local v national legislation

-   what data needed
